### Lecture on Strings and `string_view` in C++

#### Part 1: Understanding Strings in C++

In C++, the **`std::string`** class is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) and provides a dynamic, safe, and feature-rich alternative to C-style strings (`char[]`). It eliminates many of the pitfalls of manual memory management, offering tools to simplify working with text.

---

**Features of `std::string`:**
1. Dynamically resizable: Automatically grows or shrinks as needed.
2. Memory management handled internally, reducing risks of buffer overflow.
3. Rich set of member functions for operations like concatenation, searching, and modification.

---

**Common Operations**

1. **Creating Strings**
You can initialize strings in multiple ways:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str1 = "Hello, World!";          // Direct initialization
    string str2("C++ Programming");        // Constructor initialization
    string str3(5, '*');                   // Initialize with 5 '*'
    cout << str1 << "\n" << str2 << "\n" << str3 << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

2. **Concatenation**
Strings can be combined using `+`, `+=`, or member functions like `append()`:
```cpp
string firstName = "John";
string lastName = "Doe";
string fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;   // Combine strings
cout << "Full Name: " << fullName << endl;

fullName.append(" Jr.");                        // Append more text
cout << fullName << endl; // Output: John Doe Jr.
```

---

3. **Accessing and Modifying Characters**
Use the subscript operator `[]` or `.at()` to access characters:
```cpp
string word = "Apple";
cout << word[0] << endl;       // Output: A
word[0] = 'a';                 // Modify the first character
cout << word << endl;          // Output: apple
cout << word.at(2) << endl;    // Output: p (safe access, checks bounds)
```

---

4. **String Properties**
You can query or modify string properties using built-in methods:
```cpp
string sentence = "Learning C++";
cout << "Length: " << sentence.size() << endl;  // Get string length

sentence.clear();                               // Clear the string
if (sentence.empty()) cout << "String is empty!" << endl;
```

---

5. **Finding Substrings**
The `find()` function searches for a substring and returns its position (or `string::npos` if not found):
```cpp
string text = "Programming in C++";
size_t pos = text.find("C++");
if (pos != string::npos) {
    cout << "'C++' found at position: " << pos << endl;
}
```

---

6. **Inserting, Erasing, and Replacing**
Modify strings with precise control:
```cpp
string sentence = "I love C++!";
sentence.insert(7, "learning ");   // Insert at position 7
cout << sentence << endl;          // Output: I love learning C++!

sentence.erase(2, 5);              // Remove 5 characters from position 2
cout << sentence << endl;          // Output: I C++!

sentence.replace(2, 3, "enjoy");   // Replace "C++" with "enjoy"
cout << sentence << endl;          // Output: I enjoy!
```

---

#### Part 2: Introduction to `std::string_view`

`std::string_view`, introduced in C++17, is a lightweight, non-owning reference to a sequence of characters. Unlike `std::string`, it does not manage memory, making it faster and more efficient for certain use cases.

---

**Why `string_view`?**
1. **Efficiency:** Avoids copying or allocating memory for strings when all you need is to reference existing data.
2. **Flexibility:** Can reference parts of a string or even raw character arrays (`const char*`).

---

**Basic Usage**
A `string_view` can be constructed from an existing `std::string`, a literal, or a raw character array:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
using namespace std;

void printString(string_view sv) {
    cout << "Received: " << sv << endl;
}

int main() {
    string str = "Hello, string_view!";
    printString(str);                        // No copy made

    string_view sv = str.substr(7);          // Create a view of "string_view!"
    cout << "Substring view: " << sv << endl;

    const char* rawStr = "C-style string";
    string_view rawView(rawStr);             // View a raw string
    cout << "Raw string view: " << rawView << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

---

**Key Features of `string_view`:**
1. Efficient for passing large strings to functions without copying.
2. Provides many of the same methods as `std::string` (e.g., `.size()`, `.substr()`, `.find()`), but is read-only.

**Key Limitations:**
- `string_view` does not own the data. The original string must remain valid.
- It is immutable; you cannot modify the string through a `string_view`.

#### Comparing `std::string` and `std::string_view`

| Feature            | `std::string`              | `std::string_view`          |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Ownership           | Owns the string data       | Does not own the data       |
| Modifiability       | Mutable (can change data)  | Immutable (read-only)       |
| Memory Overhead     | Higher (dynamic allocation)| Lower (no allocation)       |
| Best Use Case       | When you need to store or modify text | When you only need read access |

---

#### Advanced Example: Using `string_view` for Efficiency

Consider a function that processes large strings. Instead of passing `std::string` by value or reference, we can use `std::string_view` to avoid unnecessary copies:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
using namespace std;

void findWord(string_view text, string_view word) {
    size_t pos = text.find(word);
    if (pos != string::npos) {
        cout << "'" << word << "' found at position: " << pos << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "'" << word << "' not found." << endl;
    }
}

int main() {
    string paragraph = "C++ programming is powerful and efficient.";
    findWord(paragraph, "powerful"); // Pass by view (no copy)
    findWord(paragraph, "Python");

    return 0;
}
```

---

#### Part 3: Use Cases and Best Practices

1. **Use `std::string` when:**
   - You need to modify, concatenate, or dynamically build strings.
   - Ownership and memory management are required.

2. **Use `std::string_view` when:**
   - You are working with read-only data.
   - Passing substrings or raw character arrays to functions.
   - You want to avoid the performance overhead of copying strings.

**Example of Mixing `std::string` and `string_view`:**
```cpp
void greet(string_view name) {
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << endl;
}

int main() {
    string userName = "Alice";
    greet(userName);                // Pass a string
    greet("Bob");                   // Pass a string literal

    return 0;
}
```
